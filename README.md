# Prisoner's Dilema

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is a quick 5 round 2 player game. Each round both players have the choice of confessing or not confessing. Each player has 30 seconds to make their decision. Points are then awareded. If both players choose to confess they each earn 5 points. If however one player confesses while the other does not the player who did not earns 8 points while the confessor earns 0 points. If both players do not confess they each get 1 point. Both players make the exact same choice with each other 5 times. At the end of 5 rounds, the player with the most points wins!

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever heard of the Prisoner's Dilemma? Experience this classic game theory challenge in a two-player showdown! Your options are simple: confess or stay quiet. If both confess, you each earn 5 points. If one stays quiet while the other confesses, the confessor takes 8 points while the quiet one gets nothing. But if you both stay quiet, you each earn only 1 point. The catch? You must repete the dilema 5 times! Will you trust them or play it safe? It's a chance to test your strategy and psycology!
