# Prisoner's Dilema

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application is a quick 5 round 2 player game. Each round both players have the choice of confessing or not confessing. Each player has 30 seconds to make their decision. Points are then awareded. If both players choose to confess they each earn 5 points. If however one player confesses while the other does not the player who did not earns 8 points while the confessor earns 0 points. If both players do not confess they each get 1 point. Both players make the exact same choice with each other 5 times. At the end of 5 rounds, the player with the most points wins!

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever heard of the Prisoner's Dilemma? Experience this classic game theory challenge in a two-player showdown! Your options are simple: confess or stay quiet. If both confess, you each earn 5 points. If one stays quiet while the other confesses, the confessor takes 8 points while the quiet one gets nothing. But if you both stay quiet, you each earn only 1 point. The catch? You must repete the dilema 5 times! Will you trust them or play it safe? It's a chance to test your strategy and psycology!  

### Design

The red boxes under the table are the buttons the user can press to submit their decision.

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how people would interact with the backend to play the game.

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to see both players scores in real time
- Buttons for each player to make a selection: confess, don't confess
- Wins and losses from previous games are persistently stored
- Timer counts down from 30 until scores are entered
- Shows the weather

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Handles the basic structure of the application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for the game interface. Hyperlink to artifact with scores from preious rounds. 
- **CSS** - Styles and animates the application to provide a more visually appealing design. Handles whitespace and colorchoice so that the website looks good on different devices.
- **React** - Manages the application's dynamic behavior and state. After login switches to the game interface and refreshes both the timer and user decision.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for
  - retrieving scores from previous rounds
  - submitting player choices
  - fetching game status (round number)
  - getting the weather through the getWeather api
- **DB/Login** - Store users, and previous games in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database.
- **WebSocket** - Enables real-time communication between the players and the server. Ensures smooth gameplay
